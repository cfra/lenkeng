A simple program to receive image data from the Lenkeng LKV373 HDMI-extender.

  setup-vlan.sh: Shows how to configure an interface to receive image data from
                 the extender. It is both important to add the IP address so that
                 trigger packets can be transmitted and to set the interface to
                 promisc mode so that packets will be received. (Not 100% sure
                 on the promisc though, it's been some time since I initially
                 wrote this and I started the documentation just now)

  simple_receiver.c: The actual receiver. It provides 25fps of mjpeg via a tcp port
                     configurable with -p. To select the interface that the data
                     should be received on, use the -i command line switch.

                     To compile it, you need libevent-dev. Then, you can use
                     something like this:

                         gcc -o simple_receiver simple_receiver.c -levent

  fallback.jpg: An image transmitted by simple_receiver when the data received
                from hdmi grows stale

Usage:

  sudo ./simple_receiver -i eth1 -p 81

  -i specifies the interface where the LKV373 is connected
  -p specifies the port on which the mjpeg stream should be served

Troubleshooting:

"Could not bind trigger UDP socket: Cannot assign requested address": you must assign an ip address to your nic
                                   `sudo ifconfig eth1 192.168.168.56 up`
